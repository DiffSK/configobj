Python 3+ compatible port of the [configobj](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/configobj/) library.


## Documentation

You can find a full manual at [readthedocs](http://configobj.readthedocs.org/).


## Status

This project is now maintained by [Eli Courtwright](https://github.com/EliAndrewC) and [Rob Dennis](https://github.com/robdennis) with the blessing of original creator [Michael Foord](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/).

For long time ConfigObj users, the biggest change is in the officially supported Python versions:
- 2.6
- 2.7
- 3.3
- 3.4

(notably adding Python 3 support; previously this was 2.3 - 2.6)
Other versions may work, but this is what travis and tox uses to run the tests on commit.


## Roadmap

- Fixing any issues introduced as a result of the added Python 3 support
- Moving tests away from doctests in favor of pytest (reasonable now that versions older than 2.6 are dropped)
- Considering new features that work in a backwards-compatible way (feel free to open an issue with your suggestion)
